# Create a program that asks for two numbers
# If the second number is not bigger than the first one it should print:
# "The second number should be bigger"
#
# If it is bigger it should count from the first number to the second by one
#
# example:
#
# first number: 3, second number: 6, should print:
#
# 3
# 4
# 5

a = int(input('Give me a number: '))
b = int(input('Give me another number: '))
if b <= a:
    print("The second number should be bigger")
else: 
    for i in range(a, b):
        print(i)
        i += 1
